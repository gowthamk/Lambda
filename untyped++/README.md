Commit Log:
----------

* 17/08/2013 - First commit
* 19/08/2013 - Fixed lexer error. Keywords come first because:
  "The lexer resolves con icts among rules by choosing the rule
  with the longest match, and in the case two rules match the same
  string, choosing the rule listed first in the specification."
